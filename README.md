https://threefrogs511.github.io/memochamp/

Memochamp is a browser-based game made with JavaScript. The goal is simple but challenging: memorize as many blue squares as possible within a limited time.

How to Play

When the game starts, blue squares will appear on the screen.

Your task is to remember their positions.

After a short display, you must click (or otherwise identify) the squares that were blue.

You aim to correctly identify as many blue squares as possible before the timer runs out.

Features

Adjustable timer: you can pick how many seconds you want to play.

Score tracking: the game records how well you did during each session.

Technical Details

Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Runs directly in the browser; no server side required.

Uses basic DOM manipulation and event handling.

Status

Work in progress. Some features planned or under development:

Improved visual feedback for correct / incorrect picks.

More complex levels or difficulty scaling.

Better responsiveness for different screen sizes.

Persistent high score storage (e.g. local storage or backend).

Purpose

This project is intended as both a practice in front-end development and a fun, simple memory-challenge game. Feedback, suggestions, or contributions are welcome.
